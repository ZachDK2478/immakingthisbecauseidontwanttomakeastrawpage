        <h1>DK!SONICTALE</h1>

        <p>
            DK!SONICTALE is an UNDERTALE AU (Alternate Universe) that takes Sonic the Hedgehog characters and places them into 
            UNDERTALE's world. That's the simple part. Now to go more in depth.
            <br><br>
            After a brutal battle with the Eggman Empire, Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends were on the backfoot. 
            Cream the Rabbit was attacked, but fortunately Knuckles the Echidna managed to use the Master Emerald to shield her.
            <br><br> 
            Coincidentally, this also shielded Cream from the oncoming tragedy. 
            <br><br>
            As Sonic lunged toward Dr. Eggman's cockpit, a warbling sound was heard as reality collapsed in on itself. 
            Sonic and his friends (sans Cream) were all warped into another world, and the very world they all stood upon vanished 
            from existence.
            <br><br> 
            As Cream looked around at the black abyss surrounding her, she cried out for her loved ones. 
            Her plea was cut off prematurely as she was temporarily erased from existence. 
            The mix of Master Emerald energy and whatever messed with their world placed her in a form of stasis for six years. 
            In that time, her loved ones all managed to find new lives, settling in their new home.
            <br><br> 
            Their new home is known as The UNDERGROUND, and it is the place that us UNDERTALE fans are familiar with. 
            The main changes come in the form of various Sonic the Hedgehog locales fusing with the UNDERGROUND's terrain to become entirely new landscapes.
            <br><br>
            Many secrets lie within this new world. When Cream returns, six years have passed, showing the growth of society. 
            And on top of that, she wakes up with no memory of the six years. 
            She wakes up in a new land with fresh memory of her friends and family disappearing, only to be met with Class "E" (Classie), 
            the Flowey parallel in this AU.
            <br><br>
            DK!SONICTALE is not meant to be a simple role-swap AU, and has an original story. 
            To avoid the cringe and limited story potential of placing characters in roles, I decided to lean into 
            how much each character does not belong in their role while weaponizing nostalgia using Classie/Class "E".
