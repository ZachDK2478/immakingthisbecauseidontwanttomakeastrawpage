        <h1>DK!SONICTALE</h1>

        <p>
            DK!SONICTALE is an UNDERTALE AU (Alternate Universe) that takes Sonic the Hedgehog characters and places them into UNDERTALE's world. 
            That's the simple part. Now to get more in-depth.
            <br><br>
            After a brutal battle against the Eggman Empire, Sonic and his friends were on the backfoot. 
            Cream was attacked, but fortunately Knuckles managed to use the Master Emerald to shield her.
            <br><br> 
            As Sonic lunged towards Dr. Eggman's cockpit, a strange, warbling sound was heard. 
            <br><br>
            In one moment, everything they knew and loved was gone.<br> 
            Their homes.<br>
            Their lives.<br>
            Everything.<br>
            They all ended up in a world unknown to them, but all too familiar to us. The Underground.
            <br><br> 
            Sonic retired from heroism, even his unshakable optimism dimming due to the circumstances. His home with Tails lies deep in the forest of Snowdin.<br><br> 
            Tails focused all of his efforts on finding a way home, almost to an obsessive degree, just wanting to make things right. With him, he holds a Chaos Emerald.<br><br> 
            Knuckles guards a Chaos Emerald, far into the depths of Hotland. Knuckles calls Hotland "Lava Reef" because he misses his home.<br><br> 
            Amy helps Vanilla touch up the Ruins, now known as the Chao Sanctuary, into a paradise. Vanilla holds a Chaos Emerald.<br><br> 
            Shadow took charge in place of Sonic, guarding a Chaos Emerald within New Home, now called the Last Bastion.<br><br> 
            Rouge, following Shadow's orders, was stationed in a Waterfall settlement. She guards a Chaos Emerald of her own.<br><br> 
            Dr. Eggman lies in a lab around where Lava Reef/Hotland ends, guarding the sixth Chaos Emerald and constantly experimenting with ways to return home.<br><br> 
            The cooling molten rock allows for easier analysis of the enviornment, while he can just take energy from the geothermal energy.<br><br> 
            Jet lies above most areas in a location simply called the Horizon, holding the final Chaos Emerald.<br><br>
