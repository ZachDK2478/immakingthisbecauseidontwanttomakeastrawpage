        <h1>DK!SONICTALE</h1>

        <p>
            DK!SONICTALE is an UNDERTALE AU (Alternate Universe) that takes 
            Sonic the Hedgehog characters and places them into UNDERTALE's world.
            <br><br>
            After a brutal battle against the Eggman Empire, Sonic and his friends were on the backfoot. 
            Cream was attacked, but thankfully Knuckles managed to use the Master Emerald to shield her. 
            As Sonic lunged towards Dr. Eggman's cockpit, a strange, warbling sound was heard.
            <br><br>
            In one moment, everything they knew and love was gone.
            <br>
            Their homes.
            <br>
            Their lives.
            <br>
            Everything.
            <br><br>
            They all ended up in a world unknown to them, but all too familiar to us. The Underground.
            <br>
            Sonic retired from heroism, even his unshakable optimism dimming due to the circumstances.<br>
            Tails focused all of his efforts on finding a way home, almost to an obsessive degree, just wanting to make things right. With him, he holds a Chaos Emerald.<br>
            Knuckles guards a Chaos Emerald, far into the depths of Hotland. Knuckles calls Hotland "Lava Reef" because he misses his home.<br>
            Amy helps Vanilla touch up the Ruins, now known as the Chao Sanctuary, into a paradise.<br>
            Shadow took charge in place of Sonic, guarding a Chaos Emerald within New Home, now called the Last Bastion.<br>
            Rouge, following Shadow, was stationed in Waterfall. She guards a Chaos Emerald of her own.<br>
