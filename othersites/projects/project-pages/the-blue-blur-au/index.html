        <p>The Blue Blur AU is a fanmade Sonic the Hedgehog AU that focuses on Sonic becoming a villain as a result of the 
            six months of torture he endured during the events of Sonic Forces.
            <br>
            Taking on the name of Blur, Sonic is the main antagonist of the comic's story. Tails—now going by the name of Miles—
            has, with the aid of Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik, attempted to make an artificial hero: Sage.
